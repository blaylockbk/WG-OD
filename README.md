# Welcome to WG/OD
The **Working Group on Observational Data**, is a subgroup of the Committee for Operational Processing Centers under the U.S. Interagency Council for Advancing Meteorological Services.


Use the [Issues](https://github.com/blaylockbk/WG-OD/issues) tab to submit new issues.

Use the [Discussion](https://github.com/blaylockbk/WG-OD/discussions) tab to discuss non-issue topics.

Find general group information in the [Wiki](https://github.com/blaylockbk/WG-OD/wiki) (not available for private repos)

Why GitHub?

- Access is independent of organization person belongs to (NOAA/DoD). Just need a GitHub.com account to gain access. 
- Report and track issues/tasks in the <kbd>Issues</kbd> tab. 
    - Overall better than a shared google spreadsheet.
    - Preserve history of the issue updates. *I really think this would be valuable for everyone, especially as people join and leave the group.*
    - Assign the task to yourself or specific people. (Let others know who has ownership for a task). 
- Discuss non-issues topics in the <kbd>Discussions</kbd> tab.
- Upload files: Centralized location for sharing slides give at meetings.
- List any general WG/OD details on the <kbd>Wiki</kbd>


I propose this repo be moved to a new WG/OD GitHub "organization" and add everyone in WG/OD as a member.

- **Argument for making it private:** Maybe some information is sensitive.
- **Argument for making it public:** More people outside WG/OD would be able to find/follow an issues or topic and hopefully help address them. (Leverage the wider community to address and communicate problems). You could share links to other colleagues who may be able to help with an issue.

 Note: We could create both a "public" repo and a "private" repo where access is restricted to certain people.
